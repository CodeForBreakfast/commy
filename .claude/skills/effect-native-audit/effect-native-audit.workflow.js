    'Sweep the codebase on four axes. SUBSTITUTION: domain-by-domain for logic that re-implements an Effect helper a per-line linter cannot see (inventory-first finders read Effect source + docs). STRUCTURAL: for code whose construction / DI / error / resource SPINE is still imperative OOP even though the leaves return Effect. MODELLING: for data/state REPRESENTATIONS that discard a type-level guarantee Effect data types provide — null over Option, sentinels over Either, flags over tagged unions, bare primitives over branded types, in-place mutation over immutable structures, hand-rolled equality over Equal, data-first helpers that block clean pipe composition. BEHAVIOUR: for native-but-misused / policy code — how effects RUN, FAIL, and what they TRUST — sequential when independent effects could be concurrent, unbounded fan-out at a shared service, unsupervised forks, untrusted data crossing the edge with no Schema decode, an untyped/swallowed error channel. The latter three axes read the Effect design docs and grep an anti-pattern catalogue. Adversarial verify kills false twins and unjustified rewrites; synthesis writes a report and returns confirmed findings for gated bead filing.',

  no shared/contended resource (no rate-limit hazard).
- unsupervised-fork: refute if the fork is ALREADY forkScoped/forkDaemon with its failures observed,
  or the result IS joined/awaited.
- unvalidated-boundary: refute if the data source is genuinely trusted/internal (already decoded
  upstream), the cast is to a type the program owns end-to-end, OR a *Sync decode actually exists
  (then it is the STRUCTURAL internal-bridge smell — note the reclassification, still real).

    `Synthesise the Effect-native audit for ${date}. You are given the findings that SURVIVED
adversarial verification (the refuted ones are already dropped). Coverage data is included so the
report can state what was surveyed.

Findings come from FOUR axes. kind="native-replacement"/"idiom" are SUBSTITUTION findings (a rolled
helper -> a native one). kind="structural" are SHAPE findings (an OOP/imperative spine -> an
Effect-native shape). kind="modelling" are REPRESENTATION findings (a dishonest data/state type ->
an honest one: Option, Data.taggedEnum, branded type, immutable structure, Equal, data-last helper).
kind="behaviour" are DYNAMIC findings (native-but-misused concurrency / failure / trust: sequential
work that could be concurrent, unbounded fan-out, unsupervised fork, unvalidated boundary, untyped/
swallowed error channel). Structural, modelling, and behaviour all carry \`smell\` and \`blastRadius\`
and are larger refactors than a swap.

1. DEDUP: the same file:line may be flagged by more than one finder, across axes. Merge duplicates,
   keeping the clearest mapping and citing every finder/smell that found it. Do NOT collapse findings
   from different axes into one — they propose different work (a helper swap vs a shape rewrite vs a
   representation change vs a behaviour/policy change). Watch the deliberate axis borders: modelling
   sentinel-or-throw vs structural throw-in-effect; modelling in-place-mutation vs structural
   mutable-state; modelling hand-equality / nullable-return vs the Equal / Option substitution domains;
   behaviour unvalidated-boundary vs structural internal-bridge vs modelling bare-primitive; behaviour
   untyped-error-channel vs structural throw-in-effect; behaviour unsupervised-fork vs structural
   mutable-state. If two such findings are the SAME site, keep the one whose axis matches the actual
   fix and note the other; if genuinely distinct work, keep both.
2. SPLIT for the report: confidence==="high" -> the Confirmed sections; everything else -> the
   Low-confidence section. After dedup, a line that is high in any finder is high. (The gate also
   computes the confirmed/low-confidence bead partition itself, deterministically from each survivor's
   confidence — you do NOT return those arrays; you own the report prose.)
3. Write the report to ${reportPath} (use the Write tool). Structure:
     ## Effect-native audit — ${date}
     ### Confirmed — substitution   <- table: file:line | rolled -> native | why | docsRef
     ### Confirmed — structural     <- table: file:line | smell | currentShape -> nativeShape | blastRadius | why
     ### Confirmed — modelling      <- table: file:line | smell | currentRepr -> nativeRepr | blastRadius | why
     ### Confirmed — behaviour      <- table: file:line | smell | currentBehaviour -> nativeBehaviour | blastRadius | why
     ### Low-confidence (report only)   <- all axes, noting which
     ### Coverage                   <- finders run per axis, per-module inventorySize, any fellBackToFetch
4. Return reportMarkdown (identical to the file). That is all — the gate derives the
   confirmed/low-confidence bead lists from the survivors itself.
